Are you busy, impatient and have the cooking skills of a 5 year old? If yes, then anything filed under this tag is for you! Here I’ll post “recipes” and store-bought finds that are quick, allergen-friendly and generally healthy.

First Up: Fried Banana aka “Genius Dessert”

You’ll need:

* 1 banana (firm, with no brown spots)
* 1 tbsp of coconut oil
* Cinnamon

THAT’S IT!

**Step 1:** Slice banana into ½ inch sections

**Step 2:** Melt the coconut oil under medium/high heat.

**Step 3:** Add the banana and cook until the outsides are a nice golden brown, about 5 - 7 minutes, stirring regularly.  (If you’re like me and you want ‘em extra crispy, leave on the stove for a couple more minutes).

**Step 4:** Sprinkle with cinnamon

<br>**Step 5**: DEVOUR

When the sugar monster hits, this one keeps it at bay.  Plus it’s vegan, gluten-free and Whole30 compliant.
