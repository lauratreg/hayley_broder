I’m dedicating the first Balm Beats post to Scott Melker who is one of my favorite DJs of all time.  Scott blends classics from artists such as Fleetwood Mac, Hall & Oates and Phil Collins with mainstream Hip Hop and R&B to create addictive tracks that you’ll play on repeat and send to friends with the subject line: “MUST LISTEN ASAP.”

Background: Scott was born and raised in Gainesville, Florida, where he began playing the piano and signing at the age of 5.  He moved to Philadelphia (my hometown!!) to attend the University of Pennsylvania, where he honed his craft spinning records at local clubs and college parties.

Scott is currently based out of Miami and does it all as a husband, father, DJ, producer and leader of 101 Management, a full-service entertainment firm that connects venues with top-notch talent.  Scott has played alongside the likes of Public Enemy, TI and Raekwon, performed at events for Obama, Britney and Mariah and served as the official DJ for Target and The Food & Wine Network so yea, he’s pretty legit.

Discovery: Back in the day, Scott curated tunes for Flywheel where I used to teach indoor cycling.  His Hall & Oates mixtape, “Ballin’ Oates”,  spread like fire amongst the instructors and I became an instant devotee.  I’ve been stalking him on the internet ever since and he’s always been very gracious about it (thanks, Scott!).

Why I’m obsessed: I feel like Scott Melker gets inside my head and creates remixes that I’ve always wanted but never realized I could have.  The depth of his musical knowledge is evidenced by his ability to blend opposite genres and make them seem like they were destined to be played together.  Melker understands music as “emotional currency,” [https://www.last.fm/music/Scott+Melker/+wiki] and turns every new release into payday.
