I’m dedicating the first Balm Beats post to [Scott Melker](http://themelkerproject.com/), who is one of my all-time favorite DJs.&nbsp; Scott blends classic songs from Fleetwood Mac, Hall & Oates and Phil Collins with mainstream Hip Hop and R&B to create addictive tracks that you’ll send to friends with the subject line: “MUST LISTEN A$AP.”

**Background:&nbsp;**Scott was born and raised in Gainesville, Florida, where he began playing the piano and signing at the age of 5. &nbsp;He moved to Philadelphia (my hometown!!) to attend the University of Pennsylvania, where he honed his craft spinning records at local clubs and college parties.

Scott is currently based out of Miami and does it all as a husband, father, DJ, producer and leader in the entertainment industry.&nbsp; Bragging rights include sharing a stage with Public Enemy, performing for Obama and serving as the official DJ for Target.&nbsp;

**Discovery:** Back in the day, Scott curated tunes for Flywheel where I used to teach indoor cycling. &nbsp;His Hall & Oates mixtape, “[Ballin’ Oates”](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPqtADjEoy1smbdk3Y5iOaWLIzP2m0HNF), &nbsp;spread like fire amongst the instructors and I became an instant devotee. &nbsp;I’ve been stalking him online ever since and he’s always been very gracious about it (thanks, Scott!).

**Why I’m obsessed:** I feel like Scott Melker gets into my head *Inception*-style and creates remixes that only my subconscious could dream up.&nbsp; His mash-ups are so good that it's now hard for me to listen to the original songs individually without feeling like something is missing.&nbsp;

Melker understands music as “emotional currency." When we connect with a song, we aren't just singing the words or humming the melody, but forming personal attachment as we interpret in through the lens of our experiences.&nbsp; Melker amplifies that connection when he combines the heady warmth of nostalgia with hip hop from your "Friday Night Pre-Game" playlist.&nbsp; His unique ability to look backward and forward simultaneously makes you feel understood on a holistic level. &nbsp; With Melker, every new release is payday.&nbsp;&nbsp;
